Challenge #3 - App Modernization
You receive the following email from the Engineering Manager at Travel0.
“As we are moving through our modernization project, we’re now looking at Cruise0
which as you know has been live with Auth0 for some time. We have a number of
elements we want to look at:
● We are rebuilding Cruise0 as a modern web application (SPA) in ReactJS.
● During that rebuild, we want to drive growth in the app by enabling social
login and ensure we validate Customer emails.
● Customer Branding - the marketing team wants to introduce a Cruise0
Branded log in experience to the app.
We think these things can be achieved with Auth0, but we aren’t sure how Auth0 can
support ReactJS, social, and marketing requirements.
We are looking for guidance, a solution walkthrough, and a demonstration showing
how Auth0 can help solve the above.
Deliverable
As their TAM, you will need to design a solution and build a PoC (Proof of Concept) that
shows how we can help solve the above use case leveraging the Auth0 identity platform.
Your solution will, therefore, need to demonstrate the following:
1. Show how Auth0 can support the Cruise0 app modernization on ReactJS (you are
free to build the PoC single page application in your preferred language for
demonstration purposes).
2. Show how a new customer can sign up, and how an existing customer can sign in
with email/password, and Google.
3. Ensure that customers who log in with username/password and Google, with the
same email address, will be treated as the same user. Also known as Account
Linking.
4. The application should display an error if the customer’s email address is not verified.
5. Use the New Universal Login for the Authentication Experience and customize it with
a Cruise Ship logo, title of “Welcome Aboard”, and description of “Log in to book your
travel with Cruise0”.
6. The New Universal Login prompt should also feature a background of a Cruise Ship
to meet the Marketing Teams objectives.

If you aren't able to implement every item in your PoC, that's okay, but be prepared to
explain to the Travel0 team how they'd implement it based on what you demonstrate.
In the Slack channel, post the following:
● Full source code (eg. a Github repo)
● Instructions on how to deploy and use it
We will then book a 60-minute session for you to present your solution and Q&A. Your
scheduled time with us should be treated as though you are a TAM presenting to Travel0
how to solve their particular business challenge.
● Demonstration: 20 Minutes
○ Demonstration of the solution showing how it solves the problems outlined
above.
○ During this time, you will be role playing as an Auth0 TAM presenting to
Travel0 team members.
● Solution Walkthrough: 30 Minutes
○ Walk us through how you built the solution including the code base, any
challenges, learnings, and the decisions you had to make.
● Q&A: 10 Minutes
○ Questions / Feedback.
